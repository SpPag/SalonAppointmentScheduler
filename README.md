# SalonAppointmentScheduler
This is the Salon Appointment Scheduler project that I wrote as part of freeCodeCamp's Relational Database course. I've included both the original script I wrote, as well as a stripped down version that would pass the tasks, since the original performed as expected, but just wouldn't pass the automated tests.
